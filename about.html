<h3 class="text-success">What is it?</h3>
<p>The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award is designed to educate young people outside of the classroom. Open to anyone 14-24 years old, 
  regardless of background, culture, physical ability, skills and interests, the award is perfect for experiencing the outdoors, 
  contributing to the community through service, and learning many new skills. In over 130 countries, this award is recognised 
  world wide and has inspired millions of young people to get up and involve themselves in the world. The Award is comprised of 
  three levels and four sections - Skills, Voluntary Service, Physical Recreation and Adventurous Journey. Participants complete 
  all four sections at each level in order to achieve their Award. At Gold level, participants also complete a Residential Project.</p>

<p>ressures originating ‘outside’ the state apparatus. These include demands from people who see a large state bureaucracy as 
    inefficient and wasteful, demands from business interests who claim that they can overcome these inefficiencies, and 
    pressures from client groups who seek to reduce their dependency on the welfare state by having more control over the 
    services on which they depend. Clearly, this variety of calls for privatisation means that it is not a process with a 
    uniform outcome; there exists a correspondingly wide variety of forms of privatisation.ressures originating ‘outside’ the state apparatus. These include demands from people who see a large state bureaucracy as
