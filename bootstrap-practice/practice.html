<p> A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph. 
(The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!) This placement helps readers comprehend your argument. 
 how, try this: find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go through 
 part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow the sequence of logic. When 
 you’re writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences first because they usually convey your own 
 original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence 
 and explanation.

Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively. When you’re reading a complicated 
academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through reading only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get 
the overall outline of the argument. Then you can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit 
in. And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph (instead of a topic-based outline) 
to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing.</p>
